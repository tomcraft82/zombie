The created app is using NodeJS Express framework and PostgreSQL database.

I didn't have enough time to complete everything.

I was planning also to:
- fetch exchange rates from the API and storing them in some cache (probably Redis), when it expires or missing - some new service in "common" folder
- add the value calculations for other currencies by using cached exchange rates
- calculate total value of zomie items
- add containerisation by building a base image with common stuff and additional dev and production images
- create an OpenAPI 3.0 documentation for the API
- add some unit tests with mocking
- refactor services a bit
